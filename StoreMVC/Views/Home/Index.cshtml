        <p>Despite the trend embracing the “don’t care” look of ratty muscle cars, nothing says quality like perfect paint. No, were not talking an exterior blow-over here. We mean paint that is crisp at every edge and blind corner, the kind that makes the vehicle look brand new.</p>

        <h2>Furniture restoration</h2>
        <p>We get calls from clients explaining lots of different scenarios: ‘The movers scratched my armoire to bits, the dog chewed up the legs on my couch, I spilled kitchen cleaner all over my Grandmother’s buffet!’ No matter what the situation is, the question is always the same, “Can you fix it?” Our answer is usually YES!</p>
